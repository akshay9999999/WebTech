                <h3>1)SACHIN TENDULKAR :</h3>
                <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, born
                    24 April 1973 is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team.
                    He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time
                    highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs,
                    respectively.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in
                    international cricket. Sachin was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by nomination from 2012 to
                    2018.[6]

                    Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989
                    against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and
                    India internationally for over 24 years.[7] In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him
                    the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI
                    batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[8] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that
                    was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was
                    part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup
                    appearances for India.[9] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World
                    Cup.

                    Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the
                    Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).[10][11] After
                    Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision
                    to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[12][13] He was the first sportsperson
                    to receive the reward and, as of 2023, is the youngest recipient.[14][15][16] In 2010, Time included
                    Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the world.[17] Tendulkar was awarded
                    the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket Council
                    (ICC) Awards.[18]

                    Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012,[19][20] he retired from all forms of cricket in November
                    2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[21] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in
                    total, scoring 34,357 runs.[22] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark
                    the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of the
                    post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[23] In 2019, he was
                    inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[24] On 24 April 2023, the Sydney Cricket Ground unveiled
                    a set of gates named after Tendulkar and Brian Lara on the occasion of Tendulkar's 50th birthday and
                    the 30th anniversary of Lara's inning of 277 at the ground.[25][26][27]
                    Early years
                    Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[30][31] to a Rajapur
                    Saraswat Brahmin[better source needed] Maharastrian family.[32][33] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar,
                    was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance
                    industry.[34] Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev
                    Burman.[35] Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister
                    Savita. They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third
                    child.[36][37] His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[38]

                    Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra
                    (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new
                    children in his school.[39]

                    As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised American
                    player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At
                    this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands, and carried a tennis
                    racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.[40][41][42]

                    To help curb his bullying tendencies, his elder brother Ajit introduced Tendulkar to cricket in
                    1984. Ajit introduced him to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park in Dadar. At their
                    first meeting, Tendulkar did not play well. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious
                    due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to
                    give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar,
                    apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[43][better source
                    needed]

                    Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling[citation
                    needed] to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School,[30] a school in Dadar that had produced many notable
                    cricketers. He made his debut as a cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984.[44] Prior to this,
                    Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[44] He
                    was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[45]
                    Tendulkar would practice for hours; if he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on
                    the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar
                    completed the session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar
                    considers the 13 coins he won among his most prized possessions.[46] While he was training at
                    Shivaji Park, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near the park.[44]

                    Besides school cricket, Tendulkar also played club cricket. In 1984, at age 11, he debuted in the
                    Kanga Cricket League while playing the John Bright Cricket Club.[44][47] Beginning in 1988, he
                    played for the Cricket Club of India.[47][48]

                    In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a
                    fast bowler, but the trainer, Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, was unimpressed and suggested
                    that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[49] On 20 January 1987, he was a substitute for Imran
                    Khan's side in an exhibition match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay.[50] A couple of months later,
                    former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave Tendulkar a pair of his own lightweight pads and told him
                    to not get disheartened for not receiving the Bombay Cricket Association's Best Junior Cricketer
                    Award. Of this experience, Tendulkar later said, "It was the greatest source of encouragement for
                    me".[51][52] Tendulkar served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against
                    England in the semifinal in Bombay.[53][54]

                    In 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run
                    partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School. Tendulkar
                    scored 326 (not out) in that match and scored over 1,000 runs in the tournament.[55] This was a
                    record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two junior cricketers in
                    Hyderabad, India.[56]

                    Early career
                    On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for
                    the 1987–88 season, but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he
                    was often used as a substitute fielder.[44] A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232
                    days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 not out
                    in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class
                    cricket.[57] He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after
                    Vengsarkar watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets,[30] where the
                    Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a
                    century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[58]

                    Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay's highest run-scorer. He scored 583
                    runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall.[59] In both 1988 and
                    1999, Tendulkar was picked for a young Indian team to tour England under the Star Cricket Club
                    banner.[60] In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which Bombay narrowly lost to Haryana, Tendulkar's 96
                    from 75 balls was key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70
                    overs on the final day.[61]

                    At the start of the 1989–90 season, while playing for Rest of India, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten
                    century in an Irani Trophy match against Delhi.[62]

                    In the final of 1995 Ranji trophy, Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139 versus
                    Punjab.[63]

                    In the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai against Rest of India.[63] His first double century
                    (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in
                    1998.[30][64] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic
                    first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[65] Another double century was an
                    innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as
                    one of the best innings of his career.[66][67][68]

                    In total, Tendulkar was part of 5 Ranji trophy finals, in which Mumbai won 4.[63]</p>

                <h3>2)ROHIT SHARMA :</h3>
                <p>Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987), is an Indian international cricketer and the current
                    captain of India men’s cricket team in all formats. Considered one of the best batsmen of his
                    generation and one of greatest opening batters of all time,[3] Sharma is known for his timing,
                    elegance, six-hitting abilities and leadership skills. He plays as a right-handed batsman for
                    India national cricket team in international cricket, Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in
                    domestic cricket. Rohit also captains Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles under his
                    leadership, the most by any team. With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007
                    T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both
                    tournaments.

                    Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score (264) in a One Day
                    International (ODI) match and is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in ODIs
                    and also holds the record for scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for
                    which he won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has received two
                    national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna in
                    2020. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup, the seventh time the country won the
                    title.

                    Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official
                    Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
                    (PETA). He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless
                    cats and dogs in India.

                    EARLY LIFE :

                    Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra.[4] His mother, Purnima Sharma, is
                    from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.[5] His father, Gurunath Sharma, worked as a caretaker of a
                    transport firm storehouse. Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of
                    his father's low income. He would visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli,
                    only during weekends.[6] He has a younger brother, Vishal Sharma.[7]

                    Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. Dinesh Lad, his coach at the camp,
                    asked him to change his school to Swami Vivekanand International School, where Lad was the coach and
                    the cricket facilities were better than those at Sharma’s old school. Sharma recollects, "I told him
                    I couldn't afford it, but he got me a scholarship. So for four years I didn't pay a penny, and did
                    well in my cricket".[7] Sharma started as an off-spinner who could bat a bit before Lad noticed his
                    batting ability and promoted him from number eight to open the innings. He excelled in the Harris
                    and Giles Shield school cricket tournaments, scoring a century on debut as an opener.[8]

                    Youth and domestic first-class career
                    Sharma made his List A debut for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy at Gwalior in
                    March 2005. Batting at number eight, he scored 31 not out as West Zone won by 3 wickets with 24
                    balls remaining. Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja made their debuts in the same match.[9] It
                    was Sharma's unbeaten innings of 142 in 123 balls against North Zone at the Maharanna Bhupal College
                    Ground in Udaipur in the same tournament that brought him into the limelight.[10] He visited Abu
                    Dhabi and Australia with the India A squad and was then included among India's 30-member probables
                    list for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy tournament, although he did not make the final squad.[11]

                    Sharma made his first-class debut for India A against New Zealand A at Darwin in July 2006. He
                    scored 57 and 22 as India won by 3 wickets.[12] He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in the
                    2006–07 season and scored 205 off 267 balls against Gujarat.[13] Mumbai went on to win the
                    tournament with Sharma scoring a half-century (57) in his second innings in the final against
                    Bengal.[14]

                    Sharma has spent his entire domestic first-class career at Mumbai. In December 2009, he made his
                    highest career score of 309 not out in the Ranji Trophy against Gujarat.[15] In October 2013, upon
                    the retirement of Ajit Agarkar, he was appointed team captain ahead of the 2013–14 season.[16]

                    Test matches
                    In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden
                    Gardens in Kolkata against West Indies and scored 177, the second-highest score on debut by an
                    Indian to Shikhar Dhawan (187).[17] He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his
                    home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.[18]

                    Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia after
                    he had earned a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was
                    that his natural game suited the bouncy Australian pitches.[19] Sharma played in the first Test in
                    Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian victory.[20][21] During the first Test, he sustained a minor
                    injury which saw him miss the second Test in Perth.[22] He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test
                    at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India total 443/7 and win both the Test and the
                    series.[23] After the third Test, Sharma had to return to India for the birth of his daughter.[24]

                    In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his first
                    double century in Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match.[25][26] Sharma was named as
                    vice-captain of India's Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing Cheteshwar
                    Pujara.[27][28][29]

                    Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021. Instrumental in his team's comeback
                    after a defeat in the first Test at Chennai, he scored a century, one that The Guardian termed
                    "deserves to be considered one of the greatest this century."[30] He put on 167 runs with Ajinkya
                    Rahane for the fourth wicket while making 161 runs in an innings that included 18 fours and two
                    sixes.[31] India went on to win the Test by 317 runs.[32] He top-scored for his side in both innings
                    of the low-scoring third Test in Ahmedabad with scores of 66 and 25 contributing to his team's
                    win.[33] Sharma finished the series aggregating 345 runs, the most for India, at an average of
                    58.[30] He went on to score his first overseas Test century on 4 September 2021 with an innings of
                    127 against England at The Oval, also reaching the milestone of 3,000 runs in Test cricket.[34]

                    Sharma was appointed captain of India's Test team in February 2022, succeeding Virat Kohli, ahead of
                    a two-match series against Sri Lanka.[35] Sunil Gavaskar praised his leadership and Chetan Sharma,
                    India's chairman of selectors, said: "We will groom future captains under him".[36]

                    Sharma during the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia
                    In March 2015, Sharma made his first appearance in the Cricket World Cup and played in eight matches
                    for India in the 2015 tournament in Australia. India reached the semi-final stage where they were
                    defeated by Australia. Sharma scored 330 runs in the tournament with one century, a score of 137 in
                    the quarter-final against Bangladesh.[37]

                    On 15 April 2019, Sharma was appointed vice-captain of India's squad for the 2019 World Cup in
                    England.[38] In the opening match against South Africa, he scored 122, including his 12,000th run in
                    international cricket.[39][40] He followed it up with centuries against Pakistan, England and
                    Bangladesh. In the match against Sri Lanka, hitting yet another century, he became the first batsman
                    to score five centuries in a single World Cup tournament,[41] and equalled Tendulkar's record for
                    the most centuries (6) in all World Cup matches.[42] Sharma totalled 648 runs in the tournament to
                    finish as the leading run-scorer and win the ICC's Golden Bat award, the third Indian player to do
                    so.[43]

                    Other one-day international matches
                    Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in Belfast on 23 June
                    2007. This was part of the 2007 Future Cup competition which also involved South Africa. He was
                    number seven in the batting order but did not bat as India won the game by 9 wickets.[44]

                    He scored his maiden ODI half-century (52) against Pakistan at Jaipur on 18 November 2007 and was
                    selected for the Indian squad going to the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in Australia.[45][46] In
                    that series, he scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, including 66 in the first
                    final at Sydney when he partnered Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase.[47][48]
                    After that, however, his ODI performances suffered a downturn and he lost his middle-order position
                    to Suresh Raina. Later, Virat Kohli took his position as the reserve batsman. In December 2009,
                    following his triple century in the Ranji Trophy, he was recalled to the ODI team for the
                    tri-nations tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest in the series.[49]

                    He scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010 and followed it up with
                    another century in the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring 101
                    not out.[50][51] He had a run of poor form in South Africa just before the 2011 World Cup and as a
                    consequence he was left out of India's squad for the tournament.[52]

                    Sharma was recalled to the limited-overs squad for the tour of the West Indies in June and July
                    2011.[53] In the first match at Queen's Park Oval, he scored 68 (not out) from 75 balls with three
                    fours and a six. In the third match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, he scored a
                    match-winning 86 off 91 balls after India had been reduced to 92 for 6.[54]

                    He had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 runs in the whole calendar year at the
                    very low average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
                    showed faith in him, and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting
                    order to open the innings with Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a
                    success and India won the competition, defeating hosts England in the final.[55]

                    His good form continued and, later in the year against Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur.
                    He followed that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a then-world record for the
                    most sixes (16) in a one-day international innings (since beaten by Eoin Morgan of England with
                    17).[56] On 13 November 2014, playing against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the
                    world record for the highest score in a one-day international innings with 264 from 173
                    deliveries.[57][58]

                    In December 2017, India's captain Virat Kohli was rested for the series against Sri Lanka, in
                    preparation for India's tour to South Africa, which began in the first week of January 2018. In his
                    place, Sharma was appointed team captain and India under his leadership won the series 2–1, their
                    eighth consecutive series win since defeating Zimbabwe in June 2016.[59][60] Sharma also hit his
                    third ODI double-century in this series, scoring 208 (not out) to extend his record of most ODI
                    double-centuries by a player.[61]

                    In September 2018, in the absence of many top players including regular captain Virat Kohli, Sharma
                    led India to win the 2018 Asia Cup, where they defeated Bangladesh in the final.[62]

                    On 12 January 2019, in the opening match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sharma
                    scored 133 but it was in vain as India lost by 34 runs. It was his 22nd century in one-day
                    internationals.[63] At Delhi on 13 March 2019, in the fifth and final match of a home series against
                    Australia, Sharma scored 56 including his 8,000th run in one-day internationals. It was his 200th
                    innings.[64] In 2019, he scored the most runs in ODIs by any batsman, with 1,490 runs in the
                    calendar year, including 7 centuries.[65]

                    In November 2020, Sharma was nominated for the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade award.[66][67]

                    In July 2022, Sharma became the first Indian captain to lead their team to both T20I and ODI series
                    wins in England. He became the 3rd Indian captain to win an ODI series in England, and the first
                    since 2014.[68]</p>

                <h3>3)GATE WAY OF INDIA :</h3>
                <p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai
                    (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first
                    British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain.

                    The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired
                    by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect
                    George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is
                    a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance
                    to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

                    After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for
                    important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops
                    left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle,
                    opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is
                    synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is
                    also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds
                    significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with
                    the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two
                    are used for commercial ferry operations.

                    The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi
                    parked in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises
                    following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other
                    locations in its vicinity were targeted.

                    In March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location
                    for the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019
                    The Gateway is amongst the prime tourist attractions in Mumbai.[62] The Gateway is a protected
                    monument in Maharashtra under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).[63] It is a
                    regular gathering place for locals, street vendors, and photographers.[34][15][L] In 2012, the
                    Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from its
                    original location at Elephanta Caves — where it had been celebrated for 23 years — to the Gateway,
                    due to the increased capacity offered by the venue.[64] The Gateway can host 2,000 to 2,500 people,
                    whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800.[65]

                    By 2012, the Bombay Municipal Corporation increased the plaza area around the Gateway for
                    pedestrians by restoring the area at a cost of ₹5 crores.[66] It involved the cutting down of trees,
                    reducing the garden area, replacing toilets, and closing the car park. The redevelopment led to a
                    dispute between the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and the Urban
                    Design Research Institute, and the government was criticised for poor project implementation which
                    critics alleged had failed to conform to the original plans.[66]

                    In January 2014, Philips Lighting India, in association with the Maharashtra Tourism Development
                    Corporation, undertook the expenditure of ₹2 crores to illuminate the gateway, by installing an LED
                    lighting system with sixteen million shades.[67] Philips used products from its Philips Color
                    Kinetics and LED street lighting, and did not receive any branding for the illumination project in
                    which 132 light points were created, which were reportedly sixty-percent more energy efficient than
                    the old lighting system.[67] In August 2014, the state Directorate of Archaeology and Museums had
                    proposed conservation of the Gateway by the ASI, after noting deterioration caused by saline
                    deposits from the sea.[68] An estimate of costs was to be prepared and approved by the ASI. The last
                    such conservation had been undertaken twenty years earlier.[68] An independent study had earlier
                    been conducted at the Gateway, between June 2001 and May 2002, aimed at informing future
                    conservation of the monument understanding the degree of colour changes of stones owing to seasonal
                    weather conditions and saturated colour of minerals.[69] The study found the stones of the monument
                    to appear darker during monsoon than during other seasons while the colour change in the inner
                    portions of the monument rises with variations of seasonal humidity and temperature, given they do
                    not face the sea, rainwater, or sunlight.[70] It concluded with the finding that the alteration
                    degree and overall colour change in the inner portions are higher than those in the outer portions
                    of the monument.[71]

                    In 2015, the Maharashtra Maritime Board and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority
                    approved a proposal to construct a passenger jetty near Apollo Bunder and a promenade between the
                    Gateway and the Bombay Presidency Radio Club.[22] The project was aimed at reducing crowding at the
                    Gateway by closing all its jetties and refocusing the location solely as a tourist attraction.[72]

                    The Gateway has interested companies and corporate houses such as the Tata Group, the RPG Group, and
                    the JSW Group, who have expressed their wish to maintain the Gateway and enhance its facilities.[73]
                    This happened after the state government identified 371 heritage sites under its Maharashtra Vaibhav
                    State Protected Monuments Adoption Scheme (MVSPMAS).[74] Under this scheme, companies and corporates
                    can adopt heritage monuments and give out funds for their maintenance, to satisfy their corporate
                    social responsibility.[73] The scheme also provides sponsors with the opportunity to generate
                    revenue by selling their rights to feature the heritage monuments in commercials and advertisements.
                    Other revenue-generating opportunities include the sale of entry tickets to the site and charging
                    for the use of facilities.[73]

                    In February 2019, the Maharashtra state government initiated a plan to restore, clean, and beautify
                    the monument. A project plan was to be prepared in a month.[75] The state governor, C. Vidyasagar
                    Rao, directed the Bombay Municipal Corporation commissioner and architects to submit a project plan
                    in a month on measures to be taken for the purpose.[76][77] In the same month, chemical conservation
                    was proposed by the state archaeology department noting blackening of and algae on stones and
                    surface cracks. Structural stability audit had last been conducted eight years earlier with plant
                    growth on the monument removed annually.[78] In March 2019 the state government agreed on a
                    four-stage plan to manage tourists visiting the site. This involved the physical conservation of the
                    monument, the installation of a sound-and-light show, the relocation of the anchorage around the
                    monument and a streamlined, ticketed entry system.[79] The plan followed UNESCO guidance for
                    protected heritage sites and took into account the views of interested parties, including the
                    Directorate of Museums and Archaeology, which has the monument within its purview; the Mumbai Port
                    Trust, which is entrusted with the land; and the Bombay Municipal Corporation, which controls the
                    location. The task of coming up with a suitable management plan was delegated to architects.[80]

                    In August 2019, Snapchat extended its Landmarker features to the Gateway by which users can
                    superimpose augmented reality experiences on top of their pictures of the Gateway.[81]

                <h3>4)INDIA :</h3>
                <p>India, officially the Republic of India (IAST: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25] is a country in South Asia. It
                    has been the second most populous country since at least 1950, with a current population of over 1.4
                    billion, and will overtake China to become the most populous country in 2023.[17] India is the
                    seventh-largest country by area, and is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on
                    the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the
                    west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the
                    Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar
                    Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

                    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years
                    ago.[26][27][28] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers,
                    has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[29] Settled
                    life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,
                    evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[30] By 1200 BCE,
                    an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
                    northwest.[31][32] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a
                    resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[33] The
                    Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[34] By 400 BCE,
                    stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[35] and Buddhism and Jainism had
                    arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[36] Early political consolidations gave rise
                    to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[37] Their collective era was
                    suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[38] but also marked by the declining status of women,[39] and
                    the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][40] In South India, the
                    Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of
                    Southeast Asia.[41]

                    In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on
                    India's southern and western coasts.[42] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran
                    India's northern plains,[43] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India
                    into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[44] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire
                    created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[45] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged,
                    rejecting institutionalised religion.[46] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of
                    relative peace,[47] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][48] Gradually expanding rule of
                    the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also
                    consolidating its sovereignty.[49] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians
                    were granted slowly,[50][51] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of
                    education and the public life took root.[52] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement
                    emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British
                    rule.[53][54] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent
                    dominions,[55][56][57][58] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of
                    Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[59]

                    India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It
                    is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in
                    1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[60] During the same time, its nominal per capita income
                    increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a
                    comparatively destitute country in 1951,[61] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub
                    for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[62] It has a space programme
                    which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and
                    spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[63] India has substantially reduced
                    its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[64] India is a
                    nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with
                    its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[65] Among the
                    socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[66] and rising
                    levels of air pollution.[67] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[68] Its
                    forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[69] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed
                    with tolerance in India's culture,[70] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected
                    habitats.
                    The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural
                    diversity.[109] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647
                    CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[110] When
                    his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[110] When
                    the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south,
                    who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[110] No ruler of
                    this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core
                    region.[109] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the
                    growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional
                    ruling classes.[111] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[111]

                    In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[112]
                    They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of
                    all modern languages of the subcontinent.[112] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they
                    patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as
                    well.[113] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another
                    urbanisation.[113] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South
                    Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar,
                    Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[114] Indian
                    merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took
                    the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu
                    texts into their languages.[114]

                    After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising
                    vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains,
                    leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[115] The sultanate
                    was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first
                    disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population
                    to its own laws and customs.[116][117] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century,
                    the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene
                    for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans
                    from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the
                    north.[118][119] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved
                    the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[120] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and
                    building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of
                    peninsular India,[121] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[120]</p>

                <h3> 5)KEDARNATH TEMPLE :</h3>
                <p>Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the
                    field') is a Hindu temple roughly 1200 years old[1] dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on the
                    Garhwal Himalayan range[citation needed] near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand,
                    India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the
                    months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the
                    winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next
                    six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the
                    historical name of the region.[2]

                    The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi)
                    uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple.
                    According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve
                    Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[3] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased
                    Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[4][3] The temple is one of the four major sites in India's
                    Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage
                    sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[5] It is one of the 275 paadal petra
                    sthalams expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th
                    centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars. This temple is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar,
                    Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.[6]

                    Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple
                    complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure
                    did not suffer any major damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was
                    caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a
                    barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the
                    market area were heavily damaged.[7]
                    The temple, at a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of
                    Mandakini river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.[8] It is not certain who
                    built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it
                    derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya
                    states that it is so called because "the crop of liberation" grows here.[9]

                    Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar
                    temples are narrated.

                    A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.
                    The Pandavas defeated and slew their cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished
                    to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins
                    — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin
                    and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of
                    Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
                    But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the
                    Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form
                    of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.

                    Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five
                    Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull
                    grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" — the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima
                    immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind
                    legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the
                    hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the
                    nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The
                    Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places
                    for venerating and worshipping Shiva.[10][11]

                    A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from
                    disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations
                    in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas.[10] After building the Panch Kedar Temples,
                    the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through
                    the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or
                    salvation.[citation needed].[12] The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian
                    Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking
                    similar.

                    After completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an
                    unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof
                    by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.[13]

                    The Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does not mention
                    any place called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana
                    (c. 7th-8th century), which contains a story describing the origin of the Ganges river. The text
                    names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy water from his matted hair.[14]

                    According to the hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-shankara-vijaya, the 8th century
                    philosopher Adi Shankara died at the mountains near Kedarnath; although other hagiographies, based
                    on Anandagiri's Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of a monument
                    marking the purported death place of Shankara are located at Kedarnath.[15] Kedarnath was definitely
                    a prominent pilgrimage centre by the 12th century, when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written
                    by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara.[16]

                    Kedarnath Teerth Purohits are the ancient Brahmins of this region, their ancestors (Rishi-Muni) have
                    been worshiping the lingam since the time of Nara-Narayana and Daksh Prajapati. King Janmejay,
                    grandson of the Pandavas, gave them the right of worshiping this temple and donate the whole Kedar
                    region, and they have been worshiping pilgrims ever since.[9][14][15]

                    According to a tradition recorded by the English mountaineer Eric Shipton (1926), "many hundreds of
                    years ago" one priest used to hold services at both the Kedarnath and Badrinath temples, travelling
                    between the two places daily.[17]

                    The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m
                    (12 ft) in circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the
                    temple, that has images of Parvati and of the five Pandava princes. There are four temples around
                    Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar and Kalpeshwar which form the Panch
                    Kedar pilgrimage sites.[18] The first hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five
                    Pandava brothers, Krishna, Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva and Virabhadra, one of the guards of Shiva.
                    Statues of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main hall.[2] An unusual feature of
                    the temple is the head of a man carved in the triangular stone lingam. Such a head is seen carved in
                    another temple nearby constructed on the site where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was held. Adi
                    Shankara was believed to have revived this temple, along with Badrinath and other temples of
                    Uttarakhand; he is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the
                    samādhi mandir of Adi Sankara.[19]

                    Front view of the Kedarnath Temple in October 2022
                    The head priest (Raval) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva community from
                    Karnataka.[20] However, unlike in Badrinath temple, the Raval of Kedarnath temple does not perform
                    the pujas. The pujas are carried out by Raval's assistants on his instructions. The Raval moves with
                    the deity to Ukhimath during the winter season. There are five main priests for the temple, and they
                    become head priests for one year by rotation. The present (2013) Raval of Kedarnath temple is Shri
                    Vageesha Lingacharya from Davanagere district, Karnataka.[20] Surrounding Kedarnath, there are many
                    symbols of the Pandavas. Raja Pandu died at Pandukeshwar. The tribals here perform a dance called
                    "Pandav Lila".[21] The mountain top where the Pandavas went to Swarga, is known as "Swargarohini",
                    which is located off Badrinath. When Yudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandavas, was leaving for the
                    heaven, one of his fingers fell on the earth. At that place, Yudhishtira installed a Shiva Linga,
                    which is the size of the thumb. To gain Mashisharupa, Lord Shiva and Bheema fought with maces.
                    Bheema was struck with remorse. He started to massage Shiva's body with ghee. In memory of this
                    event, even today, this triangular Shiva lingam is massaged with ghee. Water and bilva-patra leaves
                    are used for worship.</p>

                <h3> 6)TAJ MAHAL :</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white
                    marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
                    commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his
                    favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the
                    centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
                    in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                    Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                    entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                    approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000
                    artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s court
                    architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and
                    divinity.

                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim
                    art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is
                    regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history.
                    The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner
                    of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                    Etymology
                    Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara
                    (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[7] The
                    current name for the Taj Mahal is believed to be derived from the Persian تاج محل tāj mahall,
                    meaning "crown" (tāj) "palace" (mahall).[8][9][4] The name "Taj" came from the corruption of the
                    second syllable of "Mumtaz".[10][11]

                    See also: Persian language in the Indian subcontinent
                    Inspiration
                    The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz
                    Mahal, who died on 17 June that year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[12][13]
                    Construction started in 1632,[14] and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding
                    buildings and garden were finished five years later.[15] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's
                    grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj
                    Mahal.[16]
                    The complex is set around a large 300-metre (980 ft) square charbagh or Mughal garden. The garden
                    uses raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters of the garden into 16 sunken parterres or
                    flowerbeds. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble
                    water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the
                    mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called al Hawd al-Kawthar in reference to the "Tank of
                    Abundance" promised to Muhammad.[36]

                    Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific
                    names[37] and fountains. The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced
                    to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor. It symbolises the four flowing rivers of Jannah
                    (Paradise) and reflects the Paradise garden derived from the Persian paridaeza, meaning 'walled
                    garden.' In mystic Islamic texts of the Mughal period, Paradise is described as an ideal garden of
                    abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into
                    north, west, south and east.[citation needed]


                    South-eastern view with lawn
                    Most Mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre. The Taj Mahal garden is
                    unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery
                    of Mahtab Bagh or "Moonlight Garden" on the other side of the Yamuna, the interpretation of the
                    Archaeological Survey of India is that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden's
                    design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise.[38] Similarities in layout and
                    architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the
                    same architect, Ali Mardan.[39] Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation,
                    including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees.[40] As the Mughal Empire declined, the Taj
                    Mahal and its gardens also declined. By the 19th century, the British Empire controlled more than
                    three-fifths of India,[41] and assumed management of the Taj Mahal. They changed the landscaping to
                    their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of London.[42]

                    Outlying buildings

                    The western building, a mosque, faces the tomb.
                    The Taj Mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls; the side facing
                    the river is open. Outside the walls are several additional mausoleums, including those of Shah
                    Jahan's other wives, and a larger tomb for Mumtaz's favourite servant.[citation needed] These
                    structures, composed primarily of red sandstone, are typical of the smaller Mughal tombs of the era.
                    The garden-facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades, a feature typical of
                    Hindu temples which was later incorporated into Mughal mosques. The wall is interspersed with domed
                    chattris, and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the Music House,
                    which is now used as a museum.[citation needed]

                    The main gateway (darwaza) is a monumental structure built primarily of marble, and reminiscent of
                    the Mughal architecture of earlier emperors. Its archways mirror the shape of the tomb's archways,
                    and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb. It utilises bas-relief
                    and pietra dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs. The vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate
                    geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex.[citation needed]

                    At the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other, and face
                    the sides of the tomb. The backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls. The
                    western building is a mosque and the other is the jawab (answer), thought to have been constructed
                    for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse. Distinctions between the
                    two buildings include the jawab's lack of a mihrab (a niche in a mosque's wall facing Mecca), and
                    its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of 569 prayer
                    rugs in black marble. The mosque's basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar
                    to others built by Shah Jahan, particularly the Masjid-i Jahān-Numā, or Jama Masjid, Delhi. The
                    Mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary
                    and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side. At the Taj Mahal, each sanctuary opens onto an
                    expansive vaulting dome. The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[15]

                    ability to finish matches in tight situations for these reasons he is considered one of the best
                    finishers in the game ever, as well as one of the greatest wicket-keepers and captains in the
                    history of cricket.

                    Born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand),[2][3] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to
                    become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998), he was picked for the
                    1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.[4] From 2001 to

                    Railway in Midnapore, in West Bengal.[5][6] In Indian domestic cricket he played for Bihar and then
                    for Jharkhand Cricket team. Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries
                    in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining
                    recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style.

                    Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong,[7] and played his
                    first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.[8] He played his first T20I also a year later against
                    South Africa.[9] In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid and he also selected as
                    T20I captain of India in this year.[10] In 2008, he was selected as Test captain.[11] His captaincy
                    record in Tests format was mixed, successfully leading India to a series win against New Zealand in
                    2008 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against Australia while losing to
                    Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South Africa by big margins in away conditions.[12]

                    He is the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League, leading them to the

                    outstanding achievements and the Government of India honoured him India's fourth civilian award
                    Padma Shri in 2009 and third civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018. He is the only cricket captain in
                    the world to win all three of the Cricket World Cup, ICC Men's T20 World Cup and ICC Champions
                    Trophy. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian
                    Territorial Army,[13] it was presented to him by the Indian Army in 2011 for his service to the
                    nation as a cricketer.[14] Dhoni is considered one of the most popular cricket in the world.[15] He
                    is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India.

                    He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014,[16] and stepped down as captain of T20Is

                    continues to play in the IPL.[17][18]

                    Early life and background
                    Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family with roots
                    in Uttarakhand.[19][20] He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki
                    Devi.[21][22][23][4] His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora
                    District of Uttarakhand.[24] His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his
                    father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda
                    area in Ranchi.[25] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".[24]

                    Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[26] but
                    after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a
                    cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[27] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills
                    allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on
                    his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16
                    Championship, where he performed well.[4]

                    From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station
                    under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[28][29]

                    Early career
                    Junior cricket in Bihar
                    In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and
                    Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[30] Till
                    1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an
                    opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move
                    to the A division.[31] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the
                    Bihar team.[32] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the
                    senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.[33][34]

                    In the 1998–99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5
                    matches (7 innings). However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the
                    quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of
                    India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy,
                    the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar post a total of
                    357.[35] Nevertheless, Bihar's efforts were thwarted by Punjab's 839 with Dhoni's future teammate
                    Yuvraj Singh making 358.[36][37] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9
                    matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.[38] Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19
                    squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the 1999–2000 season but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as
                    East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[39][40][41]

                    Bihar cricket team
                    Further information: 2001–02 Ranji Trophy
                    Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He
                    made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket
                    team.[42] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class
                    century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season.[43] Apart from this century,
                    his performance in the 2000/01 season[44] did not include another score over fifty and in the
                    2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.[45]

                    Jharkhand cricket team
                    Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a
                    couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his
                    lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored
                    a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the
                    East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 2003–2004 season[46][47] and contributed with 244 runs
                    in 4 matches,[48] including a century (114) against Central zone.[49]

                    In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to
                    represent East Zone.[50] He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing
                    cause.[51] Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW.
                    Dhoni was discovered by TRDO[52] Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni
                    play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket
                    Academy.[53]

                    India A team
                    He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was
                    picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[54] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare
                    Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the
                    match.[55] In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India
                    A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century.[56] Continuing his good
                    performance, he scored back to back centuries – 120[57] and 119*[58] – against the same team. Dhoni
                    scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received
                    attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly[59] and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.

                    International career
                    Start of ODI career
                    The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the
                    wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[59] The team also saw the entry of
                    wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik
                    (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[59] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A
                    squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[60] Dhoni did not have a
                    great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[61] In spite of an average
                    series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.[62]

                    Breakthrough
                    In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in
                    Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest
                    score by an Indian wicket-keeper,[63] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.

                    Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series
                    (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium
                    (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply,
                    India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an
                    unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[64] The innings was described in Wisden
                    Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[65] The innings set various records
                    including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[66] a record only
                    broken after seven years by Shane Watson.[67] Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate
                    (346)[68] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was
                    rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI.[69]

                    India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against
                    Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly, scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost
                    the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method.[70] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with
                    India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to
                    help India take a 2–1 lead in the series.[71][72] The final match of the series had a repeat
                    performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4–1.[73] Due to his
                    consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for
                    batsmen on 20 April 2006, becoming the fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings.[74] His reign lasted
                    just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot.[75]

                    Two cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa from the Unitech Cup
                    due to security concerns[76] and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series against Sri Lanka
                    washed due to rain,[77] was India's prelude to another disappointing tournament – DLF Cup 2006-07.
                    Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals.
                    India's lack of preparation showed in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy as they lost to West Indies and
                    Australia, though Dhoni scored a half-century against West Indies. The story of the ODI series in
                    South Africa was the same for both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India
                    lost the series 4–0. From the start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit
                    just two fifties and averaged 25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from
                    former wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani.[78] Yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the World
                    ODI XI by the ICC.[79]

                    2007 World Cup
                    Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over
                    West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series.[80]

                    India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the
                    group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the
                    tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was
                    constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM.[81]
                    The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first
                    round.[82]

                    Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against
                    Bangladesh, after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the
                    Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man
                    of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup,
                    scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a
                    Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.

                    Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the
                    subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.[83] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in
                    December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007. He was also elected as the captain of
                    the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled his
                    idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching
                    five English players and stumping one.[84]

                    Rise through ranks
                    During the series between India and Australia in 2009, Dhoni scored 124 runs in 107 balls in the
                    second ODI, and scored 71 runs in 95 balls in the third ODI. Along with Yuvraj Singh's 78 off of 96
                    balls, India won the third ODI by 6 wickets. Dhoni took his first and only wicket in international
                    cricket on 30 September 2009. He bowled Travis Dowlin of the West Indies during a match in the 2009
                    ICC Champions Trophy.[85]


                    Dhoni batting against South Africa during the group stage match of 2013 ICC Champions Trophy
                    Dhoni topped the ICC ODI Batsman rankings for several months in 2009.[86] Michael Hussey from
                    Australia replaced him at the top spot at the beginning of 2010.[87]

                    Dhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings, at considerably
                    high average of 70.43. Dhoni was also the joint top-scorer in ODIs in 2009 along with Ricky Ponting,
                    but the latter having played 30 innings. For his performances in 2009, he was named as captain and
                    wicketkeeper of the World ODI XI by the ICC.[88]

                    Post 2011 World Cup
                    In 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years. In the
                    three-match ODI series, Dhoni top-scored for India in all three innings; however, India lost the
                    series 1–2. In the first ODI at Chennai, he helped India recover from 29/5 to help post a total of
                    227 in 50 overs. Scoring 113 not out, he had a record partnership with Ravichandran Ashwin, although
                    India had lost .[89]

                    Winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Dhoni became the first and the only captain in international
                    cricket to claim all ICC trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, he was out for a
                    duck and ended the tournament with 27 runs from two innings. However, Dhoni's field placements and
                    tactics were to India's advantage, as the team had beat the opposition by five runs (D/L
                    method).[90] He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the
                    ICC.[91]

                    Just after the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation tournament against West
                    Indies and Sri Lanka.[92] Dhoni had gotten injured at the start of the tournament itself and got
                    ruled out for the whole tournament. However, despite not having fully recovered, he returned to play
                    the final against Sri Lanka, once again only to find himself become a hero after single-handedly
                    taking India to a victory by one wicket. Dhoni scored an unbeaten 45 off 52 balls while scoring 16
                    runs in the final over required for the victory. He was adjudged Man of the match for this
                    performance.[93]

                    In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or
                    more ODI-runs against Australia.[94]

                    India toured South Africa and New Zealand in the 2013–14 season and ending up losing both series,
                    0–2 and 0–4, respectively. Against South Africa, Dhoni managed 84 runs at an average of 48.0,
                    including one half-century. Against New Zealand, he managed 272 runs which included three
                    consecutive 50-plus scores. In the third match of the series, his knock of 50 helped India tie the
                    match and eventually avoiding a series whitewash. Meanwhile, he scored his 8000th run in ODI cricket
                    on the tour.[95]

                    India won the away ODI series in England in 2014 by 3–1 and series against West Indies in India by
                    2–1 margin. Dhoni had performed, as he scored a half-century in each of the series.[96]

                    2015 World Cup
                    India's preparation going into the tournament looked poor, as India had failed to perform in the
                    Carlton Mid Triangular Series in Australia, failing to win a single match, with Dhoni himself
                    managing 70 runs from three innings and averaging 23.34.[97][98]

                    During the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage
                    matches in such a tournament. India achieved wins against arch-rivals Pakistan, South Africa (whom
                    they hadn't beaten before in a World Cup game), the UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe. In the
                    match against Zimbabwe at Eden Park, he made 85 not out chasing 288 and had an unbeaten partnership
                    of 196 with Suresh Raina. This is the highest score by an Indian captain on New Zealand soil.
                    Beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became the third overall and the first non-Australian
                    captain to win 100 ODI matches. In an unsuccessful effort against eventual champions Australia in
                    the semi-finals, he made 65 as India were unable to defend their title. Dhoni, however, performed
                    well with the bat by scoring 237 runs in 6 innings at an average of 59.25 and a strike rate of
                    102.15 and thus, became only the second Indian captain to have an average over 50 and strike rate
                    over 100 in a particular season of the World Cup.[99][100][101][102]

                    Stepping down as captain and thereafter
                    Dhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017, just ahead of
                    the ODI series at home against England.[103] In the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122
                    balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with Yuvraj Singh. The
                    century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years.[104] He was named as a wicketkeeper
                    of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy by Cricbuzz.[105] He was also named in
                    the ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz.[106]

                    In August that year, during the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo, he became the
                    first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings surpassing Kumar Sangakkara, when he stumped Akila
                    Dananjaya off Yuzvendra Chahal.[107] He reached the milestone of effecting 400 dismissals in ODIs in
                    February 2018, following the stumping of Aiden Markram in the third ODI of the South Africa
                    tour.[108]

                    Dhoni went past 10,000 ODI runs in the second ODI against England during his team's 2018 tour, and
                    became the fourth Indian and twelfth overall to do so.[109] He had a relatively mediocre series,
                    having scored 79 runs in two innings at a strike rate of 63.20.[110][111] This was followed by two
                    poor performances for him in the ODI format; the Asia Cup that he finished with 77 runs in four
                    innings at an average of 19.25[112] and the home series against West Indies where he aggregated 50
                    runs from three innings.[113] Dhoni was given rest and thus wasn't available for the selection of
                    the T20I squads for the series that followed and the Australia tour later that season.[114] However,
                    he was included in the squad named for the ODI series there.[115] In the three-match series, Dhoni
                    found form and scored half-centuries in all three games with the latter two resulting in wins,
                    helping India secure a 2–1 series victory, their first in a bilateral series on Australian soil.
                    Dhoni finished with 193 runs and was named player of the series. He also became the fourth Indian to
                    score more than 1,000 ODI runs there.[116]

                    In April 2019, he was named in India's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[117][118] In July 2019,
                    in India's semi-final match against New Zealand, Dhoni played in his 350th ODI.[119]

                    Test career
                    Following his one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005
                    as the Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper.[120] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was
                    marred by rain. Dhoni came to the crease when the team was at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling in
                    quick succession, he played an aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed.[121]
                    Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (50 off 51 balls)
                    helped India set a target of 436, where the Sri Lankans were then bowled out for 247.[122]

                    India toured Pakistan in January–February 2006 and Dhoni scored his maiden century in the second
                    Test at Faisalabad. India was struggling, where Dhoni along with Irfan Pathan tried to recover, with
                    the team still needing 107 runs to avoid a follow-on. Dhoni played in his naturally aggressive style
                    as he brought up his maiden Test century in 93 balls, after scoring the first fifty in 34
                    deliveries.[123]

                    Dhoni followed up the century with respectable batting performances over the next three matches, one
                    against Pakistan that India lost and two against England that had India holding a 1–0 lead. Dhoni
                    was the top scorer in India's first innings in the third Test at Wankhede Stadium as his 64 helped
                    India post 279 in reply to England's 400. However, Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and
                    missed many dismissal chances, including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff (14).[124]
                    Dhoni failed to collect the Harbhajan Singh delivery cleanly as Flintoff went on to make 36 more
                    runs as England set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that India was never in danger of
                    threatening. A batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and Dhoni scored just 5 runs
                    and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selection.


                    Dhoni behind the stumps
                    On the West Indies tour in 2006, Dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first Test at
                    Antigua. The rest of the series was unremarkable for Dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6
                    innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with 13 catches and 4
                    stumpings. In the Test series in South Africa later that year, Dhoni's scores of 34 and 47 were not
                    sufficient to save the second Test against the Proteas, as India lost the series 2–1, squandering
                    the chance to build on their first ever Test victory in South Africa (achieved in the first Test
                    match). Dhoni's bruised hands ruled him out of the third Test match.[125]

                    On the fourth day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua during
                    India's tour of West Indies, 2006, Dhoni's flick off Dave Mohammed to the midwicket region was
                    caught by Daren Ganga. As the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid declared the innings when
                    the confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni
                    stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies
                    side, Brian Lara, wanted Dhoni to walk off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The
                    impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and Lara's temper was on display with finger-wagging
                    against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire Asad Rauf. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and
                    Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara's action was criticised by the
                    commentators and former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of
                    his actions, but he was not fined.[126]

                    Dhoni scored two centuries in Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009, a series of three matches in which
                    he led India to a 2–0 victory. With this feat, India soared up to the number one position in Test
                    cricket for the first time in history. India scored 726–9 (decl) in the third match of this series,
                    which was their highest Test total then.[127]

                    He played his last series in the 2014–15 season in India's tour of Australia captaining India in the
                    second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2–0 before the
                    Sydney Test. Following the third Test in Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the
                    format.[128][129] In his last Test, he effected nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and
                    in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara in the record for stumpings with 134 (in all three
                    formats combined).[130] He also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an
                    Indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018.[131] He finished his last
                    innings unbeaten making 24 runs.[132]</P>

                <h3>8)NARENDRA MODI STADIUM :</h3>
                <p>The Narendra Modi Stadium, (formerly known as Motera Stadium) is a cricket stadium situated in Sardar
                    Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Complex, Ahmedabad, India. It is the largest stadium in the world, with a
                    seating capacity of 132,000 spectators.[8][9] Owned by the Gujarat Cricket Association and is a
                    venue for Test, ODI, T20I, and Indian Premier League cricket matches.[10]

                    The stadium was constructed in 1983 and was first renovated in 2006.[11] It became the regular venue
                    for international matches in the city. In 2015, the stadium was closed and demolished before being
                    completely rebuilt by February 2020, with an estimated cost of ₹800 crore (US$100 million).[12]

                    Apart from cricket, the stadium has hosted several programs arranged by the Government of Gujarat.
                    It has hosted matches during the 1987, 1996, and 2011 Cricket World Cups.[13] As of 2022, the
                    stadium has hosted 14 Tests, 27 ODIs, 6 T20I matches and 2 IPL matches including the finals of 2022
                    edition for which it got the Guinness Book of World Records for having the highest recorded match
                    attendance at 101,566 spectators.[14][15][10]

                    On 24 February 2021, the stadium was renamed as the Narendra Modi Stadium by the Gujarat Cricket
                    Association after the current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, a Gujarat native, who was also
                    the president of Gujarat Cricket Association (2009–2014) and the chief minister of the state from
                    2001 - 2014.[16] It hosted its first ever pink ball test match on 24 February 2021 between India and
                    England.[17]

                    History
                    1982–2006 (Early years)
                    Formerly known as the Gujarat Stadium, the ground was renamed in tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai
                    Patel,[citation needed] India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Before the Sardar
                    Patel Stadium, international cricket matches in the city were played at the Ahmedabad Municipal
                    Corporation's stadium of the same name (Sardar Patel Stadium) in the Navrangpura area. In 1982, the
                    Government of Gujarat donated a 100-acre (400,000 m2) stretch of land on the banks of the Sabarmati
                    River to build a new stadium. The construction of the Sardar Patel Stadium was completed in nine
                    months.[4] Since then, all International cricket fixtures for the city are hosted here. In the
                    1984–85 Australia-India series, Sardar Patel Stadium hosted its first ODI, in which Australia
                    defeated India.

                    Sunil Gavaskar was the first cricketer to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket against Pakistan in the
                    stadium in 1987.[18] In 1983, Kapil Dev took a nine-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1983, and
                    claimed his 432nd Test wicket at the stadium to become the highest wicket-taker in the world in
                    1995, which broke Sir Richard Hadlee's previous record.[19] In 1996, the ground hosted a low-scoring
                    Test match against South Africa, where the visitors lost 105–170. Javagal Srinath took six wickets
                    in the fourth inning of the match. South Africa won in a rematch game when they bowled India out for
                    76 runs in the first session of the Test match in 2008 and won the game by an inning and 90 runs.

                    2006–2015 (Rise to prominence)
                    The stadium became a focal venue of ICC Champions Trophy in 2006 and hosted five of the 15 games
                    played. In order to host the tournament, the stadium was renovated to add three new pitches and a
                    new outfield. Floodlights and covered stands were introduced at the stadium as a part of the
                    renovation program.

                    The Sardar Patel Stadium has hosted games whenever India has hosted the Cricket World Cup, including
                    the first match of the 1996 World Cup between England and New Zealand. However, while the stadium
                    hosted only one game each in 1987 and 1996, it hosted three games in the 2011 World Cup, including
                    the quarter-finals between Australia and India. Sachin Tendulkar became the first cricketer to score
                    18,000 runs in One Day Internationals. As of 19 August 2017, Sardar Patel has hosted 12 Tests, 23
                    ODIs and 1 T20I.

                    2015–2020 (Reconstruction)

                    US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Narendra Modi Stadium, 24
                    February 2020.
                    In October 2015, the stadium was demolished for reconstruction, though some media referred to it as
                    a renovation. The total cost of reconstruction was estimated to be ₹700 crores (₹7 billion (US$88
                    million)).[20][21] However, the final cost was reported at ₹800 crore (US$100 million). The
                    redevelopment, originally planned to be completed in 2019, finished in February 2020.

                    Conception
                    The idea to build the new stadium was reportedly proposed by Narendra Modi, the president of the
                    Gujarat Cricket Association and the Chief Minister of Gujarat at the time. Shortly before Modi moved
                    to Delhi after becoming the Prime Minister of India, there were discussions about minor upgrades to
                    the stadium and development of the structure at the pavilion end. Modi asked the officials to build
                    a new larger stadium instead of minor renovation work.[22]

                    Bids
                    After starting demolition work at the end of 2015, the Gujarat Cricket Association issued a request
                    for tender on 1 January 2016 in The Times of India and The Indian Express. Nine bidders showed
                    interest and purchased the tender documents, out of which three submitted Technical and Financial
                    bids on time; they were the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, Nagarjuna Construction Company, and Larsen &
                    Toubro. A Tender Commercial Committee (TCC) of nine experts was formed to evaluate tenders.
                    Additionally, STUP Consultants, a Civil Engineering consultancy firm based in Mumbai, was appointed
                    as the Project Management Consultant to evaluate proposals and technical details of each bid working
                    with the TCC.[23]

                    Each of the three bidders presented their designs, models, and technical details of their concepts &
                    designs. Because of the sheer size and complexity of the project, the bidders were evaluated on
                    multiple parameters like efficiency, resources, the time frame of completion, ease of implementation
                    etc. The bidders were ranked and weighted on all of the parameters.
                    The redesigned stadium occupies 63 acres of land, with three entry points as compared to one in the
                    old stadium, with a metro line at one of the entry points. It contains 76 corporate boxes that can
                    hold 25 persons each,[27] a 55-room clubhouse, an Olympic sized swimming pool,[27][28] and four
                    dressing rooms. A unique feature of the stadium is the LED lights on the roof instead of the usual
                    floodlights at cricket grounds. The LED lights are installed on an antibacterial, fireproof canopy
                    with PTFE membrane that covers 30 metres (98 ft) out of 55 metres (180 ft) width of sitting area.
                    The roof was done by the company Walter P Moore and was specifically designed to be lightweight and
                    separate from the seating bowls in order to make it fairly earthquake resistant.[29] The structure
                    eliminates the need for pillars and gives spectators an unobstructed view of the entire field from
                    any place in the Stadium.

                    Outside of the main ground, the stadium is able to accommodate several other features, including an
                    Olympic-sized swimming pool, an indoor cricket academy, badminton and tennis courts, a Squash arena,
                    a table tennis area, a 3D projector theater, and a clubhouse with three practice grounds and 50
                    rooms.[30] The parking lot can accommodate 3,000 cars and 10,000 two-wheelers. The Narendra Modi
                    Stadium also has a huge ramp designed to facilitate the movement of around 60,000 people
                    simultaneously. The stadium has been designed such that patrons fill the lower levels of the ground
                    for smaller events to maintain the crowd atmosphere when not at full capacity.[31]

                    It has also been planned that the stadium will be connected to the metro station by a skywalk to
                    decrease road congestion. The skywalk is planned to be completed after September 2020, and is a part
                    of the Motera Metro Station project rather than the stadium's.[32]

                    The total area of the stadium is equivalent to 32 Olympic-size association football fields. It is
                    also the only stadium in the world with 11 centre pitches on the main ground.[33]</p>

                    to have stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the
                    world. The Kullu Valley in which Manali is situated is often referred to as the "Valley of the
                    Gods". An old village in the town has an ancient temple dedicated to the sage Manu.[5]

                <h3>10)PINK CITY OF INDIA JAIPUR :</h3>
                <p>Jaipur Hindi: जयपुर formerly Jeypore, is the capital and largest
                    city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3.1 million, making
                    it the tenth most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also known as the Pink City, due to the
                    dominant colour scheme of its buildings. It is also known as the Paris of India, and C. V. Raman
                    called it the Island of Glory. It is located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi.
                    Jaipur was founded in 1727 by the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler Jai Singh II,[12][13] the ruler of Amer,
                    after whom the city is named. It was one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by
                    Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[14] During the British Colonial period, the city served as the capital of
                    Jaipur State. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of
                    Rajasthan.

                    Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India and forms a part of the west Golden Triangle
                    tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra (240 km, 149 mi).[15] It also serves as a gateway to other
                    tourist destinations in Rajasthan such as Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bharatpur, Udaipur, Kota and Mount
                    Abu.

                    On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Jaipur the "Pink City of India" among its
                    World Heritage Sites.[16] The city is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Amer Fort and
                    Jantar Mantar.

                    History
                    Main article: History of Jaipur

                    Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur
                    The city of Jaipur was founded by the King of Amber, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on 18 November
                    1727, who ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi)
                    to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water.[14] Jai Singh
                    consulted several books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under
                    the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of
                    Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra.[17] The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years
                    to complete the major roads, offices, and palaces. The architecture of the city was heavily
                    influenced by the 17th century architectural renaissance during Mughal rule in Northern India. Hence
                    much of it resembles architecture styles from around the Muslim world. The city was divided into
                    nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven
                    allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.[14]

                    During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince
                    of Wales (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876.[18] Many of the avenues
                    still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.[19]

                    In the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The wide
                    boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a
                    school of art founded in 1868.[13] The city had three colleges, including a Sanskrit college (1865)
                    and a girls' school (1867) opened during the reign of the Maharaja Ram Singh II.[20][21]

                    Large areas of the city including the airport were flooded in August 1981, resulting in the death of
                    eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River.[22] The floods were caused by three
                    days of cloud burst that produced more rain than the annual average.[23]

                    Geography
                    Topography
                    Jaipur is located in the northeastern part of Rajasthan and covers a total area of 467 square
                    kilometres (180 sq mi). The city is surrounded by fertile alluvial plains to the east and south and
                    hill chains and desert areas to the north and west.[24][25] Jaipur generally slopes downwards from
                    north to south and then to the southeast.[26] The city is surrounded by the Nahargarh hills in the
                    north and Jhalana in the east, which is a part of the Aravalli range.[26]

                    Dravyavati river is the primary drainage channel which by 2014 had degenerated into an untreated
                    sewage nallah. To address this issue, a contract for the rejuvenation of the river was awarded to a
                    consortium comprising Tata Projects and the Shanghai Urban Construction Group by the JDA.[27] A
                    13-km stretch of Dravyavati riverfront out of 47.5km was opened for residents in 2018[28] and the
                    remaining project was completed in 2022.[29]

                    Climate
                    Jaipur has a monsoon-influenced hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with long,
                    extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm winters. Annual precipitation is over 63 cm, falling
                    mostly in July and August due to monsoon, causing the average temperatures in these two months to be
                    lower compared to drier May and June. During the monsoon, there are frequent, heavy rains and
                    thunderstorms, but flooding is not common. The highest temperature ever recorded was 49.0 °C (120.2
                    °F), on 23 May 1994. The city's average temperature remains below 20 °C or 68 °F between December
                    and February. These months are mild, dry, and pleasant, sometimes chilly. The lowest temperature
                    ever recorded was −2.2 °C (28.0 °F) on 31 January 1905, 1 February 1905 & 16 January 1964. Jaipur,
                    like many other major cities of the world, is a significant urban heat island zone with surrounding
                    rural temperatures occasionally falling below freezing in winters.[30]

                    Governance and politics

                    Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha
                    Civic administration
                    The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) was established in the year 1994.[42] The area of the
                    municipal corporation is 467 square km[2] and it is governed under the Rajasthan Municipality Act of
                    1959.[42] The municipal corporation is headed by a mayor.[43]

                    JMC was recently bifurcated into two Municipal Corporations, namely Greater Jaipur Municipal
                    Corporation and Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation.[44] Originally, the municipality had 91 wards
                    and each ward was represented by an elected member. However, the Local Self Government Department of
                    Rajasthan divided Jaipur into two municipal corporations, namely Greater Jaipur Municipal
                    Corporation and Heritage Jaipur Municipal Corporation, with 150 and 100 wards each,
                    respectively.[45]

                    The latest elections were held in October 2020, which were postponed due to COVID-19.[46] However,
                    elections for the 100 wards of Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation were held on 29 October
                    2020.[47]

                    The mayor is the elected representative of the city. The current mayor of Jaipur Municipal
                    Corporation (Greater) is Smt. Somya Gurjar since 10 November 2020 and the mayor for Jaipur Municipal
                    Corporation (Heritage) is Smt. Munesh Gurjar since 10 November 2020.[48] The administration duties
                    are carried out by the municipal commissioner and his group of officials. The municipal commissioner
                    of Jaipur is Mahendra Soni (IAS).

                    The estimated municipal budget for the year 2022-23 is ₹8950 lakhs.[49] The key revenue sources for
                    Jaipur municipality are taxes which include House tax, Urban Development tax and octroi
                    compensation. Along with this it also gains revenue from various fees and user charges.[49] The
                    masterplan for the city 2025 was created by the Jaipur Development Authority.[50]

                    Legislative assembly and state agencies
                    Jaipur consists of two parliamentary constituencies Jaipur and Jaipur Rural.[51] The political party
                    with a majority in Jaipur is the Indian National Congress. It also has electives from the BJP and
                    INC.[52]

                    The Jaipur Lok Sabha constituency comprises eight Vidhansabha (legislative assembly) segments, all
                    of which fall partly in Jaipur city.[53] MLA for Hawa Mahal is Mahesh Joshi from INC, MLA for

                    current Police Commissioner for Jaipur City Police is Anand Srivastava.[57] In Jaipur City, there is
                    a District and Sessions court present. It also has a family court.[58]

                    The District Collector or District Magistrate for Jaipur City is Prakash Rajpurohit.[59]

                    Civic utilities
                    Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is the nodal government agency responsible for the planning and
                    development of Jaipur. Jaipur also falls under the Jaipur district of the state of Rajasthan in
                    western India. There are 13 tehsils in the district, which are named Jaipur, Amer, Bassi, Chaksu,
                    Chomu, Mojmabad, Jamwa Ramgarh, Phage, Phulera, Kotputli, Sanganer, Shahpura, Viratnagar. The total
                    area of the district is 14068 square km.[60]

                    Jaipur Municipal Corporation is responsible for maintaining the city's civic infrastructure and
                    carrying out associated administrative duties.[61]

                    Electricity in Jaipur City is supplied through Jaipur Vidyut Vitaran Nigam LTD(JVVNL) by the
                    Government of Rajasthan.[62] Jaipur MC has a fire department wing and there are 11 fire stations,
                    with 50 fire tenders in the state capital. However, with the city is expanding and the population
                    increasing, the existing infrastructure is not sufficient to cater to the city's requirements.[63]
                    Jaipur, a Tier 2 city, also does not have rescue tenders, used for cutting material, or a turntable
                    ladder (TTL), used for dousing flames from aerial angles without entering the building.[63]

                    Water supply, sewerage and drainage
                    The Rajasthan government has formed the Jaipur Water Supply and Sewerage Board (JWSSB) for the
                    management of water supply and sewerage services in urban areas of the city. JWSSB, an autonomous
                    body, has been constituted under the JWSSB Ordinance, 2018.[64] It will ensure water supply as per
                    the standards stipulated by the Bureau of Indian Standards, the State Pollution Control Board or
                    Rajasthan's Public Health Engineering Department (PHED).[64] JWSSB will be responsible for
                    financing, designing, constructing, altering, repairing, operating, and maintaining various water
                    supply and sewerage schemes. It will also provide meters and carry out commercial services such as
                    meter reading, billing, and revenue collection.[64]
